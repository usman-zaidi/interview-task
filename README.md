## Interview Task

CSV Import Script that uses laravel bus queue services to import large file records 
in batches of 100. I have used event to send email to xxx@xxx.xxx when we have some alredy existing SKU 
exist in database.


Please follow these steps to test and verify:

Just clone the project:

composer install

password: password

Import csv and verify the project!







/home/usman/Desktop/interview-task/app/Models/ProductVariant.php, please find this file and uncomment the line 32 to send email notification, I can't use real SMTP creds.
